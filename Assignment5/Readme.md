### 5. Applications of various waves generator

##  A) Square Wave
	* Clock Signal
	* As baseband signal through wired media
	* Eliminating noise in USB technology
	* Coding for light source, for optical communication
	* Control motor with pulse width modulation.
  
##  B) Triangular Wave
	* Response or stimulus testing, frequency response characterization

##  C) Sawtooth Wave
	* Sawtooth waves are known for their use in music.
	* The sawtooth and square waves are among the most common waveforms used to create sounds with subtractive analog and virtual analog music synthesizers.

##  D) Staircase Wave
	* Applications in the field of electronics, such as in television systems, telemetry, and analogue and digital communications.

##  E) Symmetric Staircase Wave
	* As a storage counter.

##  F) Sine Wave
 	Applications of sine wave generator mainly involves in the following
	* House appliances
	* Industries
	* AC motors
	* Refrigerators
	* Television
	* Radio
